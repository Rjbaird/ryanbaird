This is where I save links to things I've done or what I think. Not so much a portfolio but a hub/reference to places where I am on the internet.

## Communication & Contact:

If you see any issues with my site, I would love to get bug reports, especially about accessibility, UI and rendering issues, performance problems, and any overall usability criticism. If you disagree with what I say on my personal, 100% opinion based blog, you can [report an issue](https://github.com/Rjbaird/ryanbaird/issues) on any post or fill out the [/contact](https://ryanbaird.com/contact) form. I'm always open to friendly discussions.

I hope to all issues but I could also just be busy ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

The best way to submit these issues is using this repo's Issue tracker.

I can also be reached on X (rip Twitter), as well as on the other social networking services linked to on my site.
