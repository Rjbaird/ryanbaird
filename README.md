## Motivation:

This is where I save links to things I've done or what I think. Not so much a portfolio but a hub/reference to places where I am on the internet.

## Contributing & Contact:

If you see any issues with my site, I would love to get bug reports, especially about accessibility issues, UI and rendering inconsistencies, performance problems, and any overall usability criticism. I guess if you disagree with what I say (on my personal, 100% opinion based blog), you can report an issue on any post. I'm always open to discussions but if you're rude, you may not get a reply.

I could also just be busy ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

The best way to submit these issues is using this repo's Issue tracker.

I can also be reached on Twitter, as well as on the other social networking services linked to on my site.
