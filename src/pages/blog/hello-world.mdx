Starting a blog is a goal I put off for way longer than I'm proud of.
Simply put, I don't like feeling vulnerable and putting my thoughts into the world terrifies me.
Usually, some existential dread gets me to stop whatever writing project I've commited myself to.
The habit never sticks.

### So why now?

Over that past year or so, I've fallen deeper into web development frameworks.
Two projects caught my attention the most: [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) & [Astro](https://astro.build/).
Both frameworks have a focus on essentialism and performance while also being relativly beginner-friendly.
I had to try them out.

One project I've had on the shelf for a while was to redesign my personal website/portfolio.
It was build with React and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and I wanted to rebuild it with something like Next.js with the new blog category.
Due to the previously mentioned feer and overall lack of skill to build that website, it was quickly abandoned.
But with Astro, adding SolidJS is easy.
Adding TailwindCSS is easy.
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)? Easy.

Well there's really no excuse now is there...

### So what now?

Depending on when you see this post, the content may change.
Over time, I'll update how post are styled (Thank you [Tailwind Labs](https://youtu.be/J0Wy359NJPM)).
Hell the content of this post may even completely change.

The plan is to simply push new post up to GitHub with the rest of the code.
This lets me add version control to the whole blog while also giving me automatic deployments with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
It's overall a crazy simple yet effective system. 

Right now, I'm pretty happy with the results.


### So what about style?

I want to talk about how I decided on a style for the blog. 
Talk about adding prose with Tailwind for the markdown content, deciding on [color](https://reasonable.work/colors/) and [icons](https://icones.js.org/) from [astro-icons](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon#readme)
