Here's everything (and more) that you'll want to know about my work experience and formal education. I've had various career paths/interest so feel free to ask about anything.

## My Developer Journey

In the middle of 2020, I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp. I wanted to understand how the internet worked better after years of selling technology, primarily mobile devices. Over time, I had become more and more interested in the software side of things, learning how to automate tasks with [Google Apps Scripts](https://www.google.com/script/start/ "Google Apps Scripts") and [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python"), in addition to building simple websites with HTML5 and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

After completing the bootcamp, I worked as a freelance developer, helping business streamline processes and systems. It felt great to build valuble things for people.

Eventually, I started working for [Proozy](https://www.proozy.com/ "Proozy.com"), an outlet e-commerce retailer built on [Shopify Plus](https://www.shopify.com/plus). While there, I learned that I loved focusing on site performance, accessibility and sustainability.

Recently, I've been working on all sorts of projects.
Examples include:

-   a url shortener with the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/)
-   a client-side note-taking app with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/ "SolidJS") + [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API "IndexedDB")
-   a REST API + RSS feed for Shonen Jump manga with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) + [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) + [Zod](https://zod.dev/ "Zod")
