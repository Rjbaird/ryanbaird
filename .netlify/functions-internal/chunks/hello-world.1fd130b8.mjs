    "\nStarting a blog is a goal I've put off for way longer than I'm proud of.\n\nI rarely even share my thoughts on any social media platform. A random retweet here or there and a few reddit post spread over a few years. There's a sense of fear around putting my thoughts into the world for others.\nSo I avoided it. The habit never sticks.\n\n### So why now?\n\nWhen I created my first website/portfolio, I used what I thought was right outside my comfort zone: [React](https://reactjs.org/).\n\nIt was the last topic in my bootcamp, right when my exhaustion was at it's peak. Eventually, I completed it, using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and Firebase for basic hosting. I planned to eventually convert everything over to Next.js, with the option to simply use Markdown files as post. No need for an additional CMS solution. Completely outside what I could do at the time but still a dream.\n\nSince then, I moved on to different projects. I got developer job where I started to learn about site speed, image optimization, accessibility.... The list goes on.\n\nAs I fell deeper into learning about all the different web development frameworks and optimization decisions, two projects caught my attention the most:\n\n[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) & [Astro](https://astro.build/).\n\nBoth frameworks have a focus on minimalism and performance while also being relatively beginner-friendly. I have a bias towards anything built around essentialism, productivity and was, all things considered, a relatively beginner-developer. It was perfect.\n\n### So what now?\n\nDepending on when you see this post, the content may change. Hell even the content of this post may completely change. I want this to be a living document. For now, the plan is to simply push new post up to GitHub with the rest of the code.\n\nThis lets me add version control to the whole blog while also giving me automatic deployments with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). For any post, you can look back at all the edit, mistakes, corrections and clarifications. Hopefully that makes this all a little more human.\n\nIt's overall a crazy simple yet effective system.\n\nRight now, I'm pretty happy with the results.\n";
